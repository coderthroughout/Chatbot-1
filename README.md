## Introduction

Chatbots are becoming increasingly prevalent in various applications, from customer service to personal assistants. This project aims to provide a straightforward implementation of a chatbot, focusing on basic conversational capabilities. It utilizes simple pattern matching and response generation techniques to simulate a conversation.

## Features

-   **Basic Pattern Matching:** Matches user input with predefined patterns.
-   **Response Generation:** Generates appropriate responses based on matched patterns.
-   **Simple Conversational Flow:** Maintains a basic conversational context.
-   **Extensible Design:** Easily add new patterns and responses to expand functionality.
-   **Command line based interaction:** Simple interaction through the terminal.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/coderthroughout/Chatbot-1.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/coderthroughout/Chatbot-1.git)
    cd Chatbot-1
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the chatbot:**

    ```bash
    python chatbot.py
    ```

2.  **Interact with the chatbot:**

    -   Type your messages and press Enter.
    -   The chatbot will respond based on predefined patterns.
    -   Type "exit" or "quit" to end the conversation.

3.  **Example conversation:**

    ```
    You: Hello
    Chatbot: Hi there! How can I help you?

    You: What is your name?
    Chatbot: I am Chatbot-1.

    You: exit
    Chatbot: Goodbye!
    ```

## Architecture

The chatbot's architecture is simple and straightforward:

-   **Pattern Matching:** Uses regular expressions or simple string matching to identify user input patterns.
-   **Response Generation:** Selects a response from a predefined list based on the matched pattern.
-   **Main Loop:** Manages the conversational flow, receiving user input and generating responses.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Input] --> B(Pattern Matching);
    B --> C{Match Found?};
    C -- Yes --> D[Response Selection];
    C -- No --> E[Default Response];
    D --> F[Chatbot Output];
    E --> F;
    F --> A;
